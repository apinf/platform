# API Umbrella Dashboard
Dashboard component for the open-source API management platform [API Umbrella](http://nrel.github.io/api-umbrella/).

# Documentation

All planning documents, meeting minutes, etc. can be found on the [Apinf Hackpad](http://apinf.hackpad.com).

# Architecture and ecosystem
Diagrams of the Apinf minimum viable product (MVP) architecture and ecosystem.

Currently, there are two options for the architecture:

* In option A, we will develop our own dashboard and use the API Umbrella Admin API to build Apinf features.
* In option B, we will extend the current API Umbrella Web platform to include a dashboard.

The decision on the architecture to be made once we understand the API Umbrella Admin API better.

For the ecosystem, we will concentrate on open APIs in the MVP phase. For the API consumer side, there are two API consumer personas: [Jukka and Minh](https://cdn.rawgit.com/apinf/api-umbrella-dashboard/master/docs/UX/APINF%20consumer%20personas.pdf). API owner personas to be added later.

The `api_umbrella` settings include an API Key, Admin Auth Token, and API Umbrella base URL. You can get the API Key and Admin Auth Token from API Umbrella, by following the instructions in the [Meteor - API Umbrella integration package](https://github.com/brylie/meteor-api-umbrella#installation).

## mail
The mail object contains a username and password for the Mailgun service.
