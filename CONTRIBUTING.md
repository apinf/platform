# Contributing code
When contributing code, please follow the [Gitflow guidelines](http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/). Specifically:

1. Create a new feature branch from the `develop` branch
2. Prefix your feature branch name with `/feature`

Additionally, the following steps help our team stay coordinated:

1. Immediately open a pull request by comparing your branch against the `develop` branch
2. Label your pull request as `WIP`, so that other developers can see the work in progress
3. When ready for review, @mention the development team, so that we know to review your code

**Important:** Getting developer feedback is part of our peer review process. It helps to highlight issues and improvements early in the process.

## Copyright statement in source code

All files should have a copyright statement at the top.
In practise it means that if you create a new file, you need to include a copyright statement as a comment at the top of it.

## CSS styleguide

File structure:

*   Each template - own style file
*   Each style file - overriding section, function section
*   Everything global - global.less file

## Code quality
In a nutshell, **write code for humans to read and understand**. Our code will be minified for machines during the build process. For further reference, please read the following:
- [Human JavaScript](http://read.humanjavascript.com/) by Henrik Joreteg
- [Clean Code rules for JavaScript](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript)

### Simplicity and safety
When writing code, tend towards simple and explicit solutions. Avoid cleverness when possible, as it may come back to bite us.

Please read and follow the following guidelines:

- [10 Rules for Writing Safety Critical Code](http://spinroot.com/p10/)
- [The Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)

### Importing 

Add importing statements right after the copyright notice.

The sections should be one of the below and the comments must be exactly the same text. They also should follow this order unless `eslint` complains about it.

* Meteor packages imports - anything imported straight from meteor
* Meteor contributed packages imports - contributed packages, like kadira:flow-router or tap:i18n
* Collection imports - all collections needed by the current file
* APInf imports - any custom file, probably from `/core`
* Npm packages imports - if importing packages from npm are needed

Examples below:

```js
// Meteor packages imports
import { Template } from 'meteor/templating';

// Meteor contributed packages imports
import { FlowRouter } from 'meteor/kadira:flow-router';

// Collection imports
import ApiMetadata from '../../collection';

// APInf imports
import formatDate from '/core/helper_functions/format_date';

// Npm packages imports
import _ from 'lodash';
```

### Comments
*Every* significant line of code should have an accompanying human language (English) comment. Generally, comments should be placed on the line preceeding the code. This is for several reasons:

* Comments act like a pair-programmer, explaining the code to other developers or your future self
* Comments may illuminate errors
  * logical errors where code is not doing what is expected
  * semantic errors where the code is not [literate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)
* Natural language is easier for the human mind to parse than computer code
* Placing comments on the preceeding line, as opposed to the end of the line, improves readability
 * comment can be long, e.g. 80 characters
 * comments at same level of nesting fall in-line with one another vertically

#### Example comment
```js
// Try and find the missing widget
let missingWidget = Widgets.findOne({missing: true});
```

### One task per line
Each line of code should perform only one action. When chaining is important, each chained aciton should be placed on a new line.

#### Chaining example

Chained methods

```js
let pizza = new Pizza();

pizza
  .cook()
  .slice()
  .serve()
  .enjoy();
```

#### Complex line example
A complex line can be split into parts.

```js
// Complex line
let missingWidgetCount = Widgets.find({missing: true}).fetch().length;
```

```js
// Safer in parts
let missingWidgets = Widgets.find().fetch();

if (missingWidgets) {
 // Count the missing widgets
 let missingWidgetsCount = missingWidgets.length

 // Alert the boss!
 
}
```

### Variables
Use semantic variable names. Semantic variable names have the following traits:

* They succinctly describe what they represent
* Words are fully spelled out
* Variables with multiple words use camel case notation
* When used in subsequent lines of code, the variable name reads as close to a plain language sentence as possible

#### Variable examples
Here are some not so meaningful variable names:

```js
// Stuff to eat (somewhat healthy)
let array1 = ["pizza slice", "yogurt", "strawberries"];

// Stuff to disgard
let array2 = ["tattered shoe", "broken pencil", "crumpled paper"];

// Things might get confusing later on
eat(array2);
disgard(array1);
```

Meaningful variable names carry their meaning through the code.

```js
// Stuff to eat
let food = ["pizza slice", "yohgurt", "strawberries"];

// Stuff to disgard
let trash = ["tattered shoe", "broken pencil", "crumpled paper"];

// Now it all makes sense!
eat(food);
disgard(trash);
```

### Code standard(s) and Lint

[eslint](https://eslint.org) is configured to run on every commit on Continuous Integration server.

The project is configured with the Airbnb styleguide and meteor recommendation for eslint.

To run locally, do:

```bash
yarn run lint
```

### Indentation
Indent all HTML(Blaze) and JavaScript code with two spaces for each level of nesting.

Also, nest most/all HTML child elements -- i.e. avoid having multiple inline elements.

```html
<p>
  <!-- nesting is important for readability -->
  <!-- e.g. when adding long internationalization keys -->
  Paragraph text.
</p>
```
### Quotes
Please use quotation marks (`""` and `''`) consistently. In general,

- use single quotes in JavaScript
  - e.g. 'here is a string'
- use single quotes in handlebars
  - e.g. `{{_ 'i18n_token' }}`
- use double quotes in HTML
  - e.g. `<a href="...">Link</a>`

### Whitespace
Please use consistent whitespace in project files. In general, whitespace is used to help people read our code.

- use two spaces for indentation in HTML and JavaScript files

##### Handlebars helpers
Please observe the following structure when working with handlebars syntax:

- Handlebars (`{{`) and prefixes (`>`, `#`, `/`, and `_`) should be placed next to each other.
  - Examples: `{{> ... }}`, `{{# ... }}`, `{{/ ... }}`, `{{_ ... }}`
- include a space before the closing handlebars `}}`
  - Example: `{{ ... }}`
- use spaces on both sides of handlebars words
  - Examples: `{{# if }}`, `{{ else }}`, `{{_ 'i18n_token' }}`

## File structure
This project is organized around a 'module' / 'component' architecture.

By 'module', we mean anything that has it's own database collection and one or more routes. Components are more closely related to the idea of [WebComponents](http://webcomponents.org/), which are intended to be reusable, hierarchical user interface elements. Modules are located in the project root, with components in the client sub-directory.

In general, our module structure follows this pattern:

* **/module_name**
  * **client/**
    * **component_one/**
      * *component_one.css*
      * *component_one.html*
      * *component_one.js*
      * **sub_component/**
        * *sub_component.css*
        * *sub_component.html*
        * *sub_component.js*
    * **lib/**
      * *router.js*
  * **collection/**
    * *index.js*
    * *schema.js*
    * *permissions.js*
    * *helpers.js*
    * **server/**
      * *publications.js*
  * **server/**
    * *methods.js*

### File names
Please use underscores in folder and file names, rather than hyphens or camel case. E.g.

```js
folder_name/file_name.css
folder_name/file_name.html
folder_name/file_name.js
```
## Collection/Schema structure
After some trial and error, we have settled on the following pattern for defining collections and schemas:

```js
// inside 'component/collection/index.js'

// Define collection name variable with corresponding MongoDB collection name in camelCase
const CollectionName = new Mongo.Collection("collectionName");

// Export the collection
export { CollectionName };
```

Next, we need to attach a schema to the collection, for validation, etc.

```js
// inside 'component/collection/schema.js'

// Import the collection using relative path
import { CollectionName } from './';

// Define the collection schema, by attaching a 'schema' property
CollectionName.schema = new SimpleSchema({
  // Schema field definitions
});

// Allow collection internationalization
CollectionName.schema.i18n("schemas.collection_name");

// Attach schema to collection for validation, etc.
CollectionName.attachSchema(CollectionName.schema);
```
### Explicit required fields
When defining schemas, we need to designate some fields as *required* or *optional*. By default if we do not designate a field as *required* or *optional*, it will be implicitly *required*.

Following the guideline of **explicit is better than implicit**, all fields should be explicitly defined as *required* or *optional*:

```js
// Schema object
requiredField : {
  ...
  optional: false
},
optionalField: {
  ...
  optional: true
}
```

### Schema changes

To make upgrading convenient & keep application database consistent we want to have
a proper data migration path for the application.

As a developer, provide a proper migration step in your PR if you make changes to any
collection schema structure.

Location for migrations is under /core/migrations/server/

**Steps:**

* Add a new file for migration, format (migration-version-number)-(short-migration-name).js
* Write migration function for 'up' step

Example migration step:

```js
Migrations.add({
  version: 1,
  name: 'Adds pants to all people in the db.',
  up () {
    // code to migrate up to version 1
    // Add pants to all people that don't have.
  }
});
```

We are using *percolate:migrations* package for migrations. For additional info check
[README](https://github.com/percolatestudio/meteor-migrations/edit/master/README.md).

- Meteor Guide: [Collections and Schemas](https://guide.meteor.com/collections.html#schemas)

## Internationalization (i18n)
To the extent possible, all user-facing text should be internationalized. To add internationalization support for texts, we use the following conventions.

### i18n key structure
Internationalization keys in our project use the following elements, separated by underscores
- `templateName` - the name of the template as it appears in either:
  - the `<template name="templateName">`
  - the `{{# AutoForm id="formName" }}`
- `pageElement` or `event` - indicate the page element or JS related event
- `additionalText` - additional text to distinguish this string from others (optional)


### Template text (HTML/Blaze)
Text in HTML/Blaze templates can be internationalized by adding an i18n tag:

```html
{{_ "templateName_pageElement_additionalText" }}
```

A specific example, found on a page element heading:

```html
<!-- note the element nesting, for readability -->
<h1 class="page-header">
  {{_ "pageTemplate_header_text" }}
</h1>
```

### JavaScript text
When internationalization strings are used in JavaScript, use the following pattern:

1. fetch the ii18n string and store it in a descriptive variable
2. use the i18n variable in related code

For example, when showing an `sAlert` to the user:

```js
// Get a translation string
const message = TAPi18n._("templateName_event_translationString");

// Use the translation string
sAlert.warning(message);

```

# Packages
The project is built using the [Meteor.js framework](https://meteor.com). The following Meteor packages provide important functionality.

## Forms
[AutoForm](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-autoform) is used to provide easy input forms, based on schema definitions (see below).

## Routing
* [Iron Router](https://github.com/iron-meteor/iron-router) is used for project routing.
* [Simple JSON Routes](https://github.com/stubailo/meteor-rest/) is used where only JSON data is needed from a route.

## Schema
[Simple Schema](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-simple-schema) is used to create schemas for our database collections.

## Templating
[Blaze](https://meteor.github.io/blaze/) is the templating language used in our project packages.

## CSS
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) is the primary CSS framework for the templates.
