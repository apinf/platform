Apinf versioning scheme
====================

* We are using standard semantic versioning in the Apinf project:
  * Version numbers refer to Major.Minor.Patch, use numerals without leading zeros
  * Alpha and beta spelled out for clarity, e.g. 1.0.0-alpha.
  * Rc should be used for release candidates, e.g.1.0.0-rc1
  * First release will be 0.1.0
* For any milestone, we shall make a stable release.
* There will be at least one pre-release for every sprint:
  * To be made on Mondays prior to new sprint planning
  * Rotating release task responsibility, working with project owner
* Nightly builds made from development branch and not tied to official releases.
* 0.1.0 to be made from master, requires pulling from the dev branch.
* Each time we make a release, we need to decide whether itâ€™s a minor version or a patch.
