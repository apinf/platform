  ### Providing traffic information of APIs ###

  When API calls are redirected via proxy, data about API calls (requests and responses)
  is collected automatically.
  Based on this data, the API owner gets information of API usage.

  With this API the proxies can be
  - created
  - listed
  - modified
  - removed.

  Example calls:

  GET /proxies

  Result: Responds with HTTP code 200 and a list of available proxies.
  `,
  // --------------------------------------------
  getAllProxies: `
  ### List all available proxies ###

  Admin user can get list of available proxies.

  On successful case the response contains list of existing proxies including following information
  - proxy id
  - proxy name
  - proxy description
  - proxy type

  Depending on proxy type, there is information accordingly either about
  apiUmbrella of EMQ
  - API Umbrella
    - proxy URL
    - API key
    - authentication token
    - elastic search URL.

  - EMQ
    - brokerEndpoints
      - Protocol
      - Host
      - Port
      - TLS activation status
    - httpApi
    - elastic search URL

  Example calls:

    GET /proxies

  Result: Responds with HTTP code 200 and a list of available Proxies containing
  proxy information by proxy type.

  If no proxies are defined, returns an empty list.

  getProxy: `
  ### List details of an identified proxy ###

  Admin user can get information of a proxy identified with proxy id.

  On success returns list of proxy's details
  - proxy id

  - proxy description
  - proxy type.

  Depending on proxy type, there is information accordingly either about
  apiUmbrella of EMQ
  - API Umbrella
    - proxy URL
    - API key
    - authentication token
    - elastic search URL.

  - EMQ
  - brokerEndpoints
    - Protocol

  deleteProxy: `
  ### Remove an identified proxy ###

  Admin user can delete an identified Proxy.

  Example call:

    DELETE /proxies/<proxy id>

  Result: deletes the Proxy identified with <proxy id> and responds with HTTP code 204.

  The parameter set according to selected proxy type is mandatory.

  API Umbrella:
  - umbProxyUrl = proxy URL
  - umbApiKey = API key
  - umbAuthToken = Authentication Token
  - esUrl = ElasticSearch URL

  EMQ:

  At least one parameter in set according to proxy type must be given.
  Parameters in wrong set must not be given.

  With parameter *beIndex* it is indicated, which broker endpoint data is to be modified.
  Also a new broker endpoint occurrence can be added to
  - a hole in broker endpoint list (*beIndex* points to hole) or
